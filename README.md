# Youtube Synthesia to MIDI

Are you a penny-pinching upcoming musician like me, that wants to learn how to play the piano without paying a single cent?

Great this repo has you covered!

Now run the script, answer a few simple questions, and there you go! You have a semi-beautiful midi file to further convert to sheet music or anything you'd like.
